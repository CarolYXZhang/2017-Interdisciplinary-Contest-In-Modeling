Our team chose *Problem E: Sustainable Cities Needed!* which was about to evaluate the city's smart growth. As for smart growth, it is an approach to development that encourages a mix of building types and uses, diverse housing and transportation options, development within existing neighborhoods, and community engagement.

## Final Result

Our team got the *Meritorious Winner* arward which was the top 7% of about 7,000 participants.

## Abstract
Our goal is to study the indicators of Smart Growth and further evaluate the success of smart growth of two cities with a population between 100,000 and 500,000 persons. We conduct models to analyze the statics from two cities’ statistical bureau database.

Firstly, we polish Galster and Hanson’s Urban Sprawl Index and set up the influencing factors of smart growth, including urban land output, urban employment, urban land revenue, Gini coefficient, corruption perception index, density, urban population expansion index, urban economic expansion index and air quality index. Then we employ a modified AHP model to get the weight value of each indicator. We set New York as benchmark to evaluate the two selected cities and New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver, Miami. We testify the feasibility and reliability by comparing the results with Galster and Hanson’s ranking for six cities. We also testify it with Sensitive Analysis.

Secondly, we select Jiayuguan City in China and Salt Lake City to do case study. Along with the Smart Growth Index, we measure the success of two cites’ current plans. Then we adopt Grey Prediction Model to forecast future value of each indicator, which we associate with the background of the city including geography, the expected growth rate and economic opportunities to form our specific Smart Plans for two cities. Then we rank the initiatives of the smart growth plans with Principal Components Analysis.

Finally, we assume that there are additional 50% population in 2040, and our smart plan can perfectly support this kind of growth in the way of density, land use, economic growth, social equity and environment initiatives.

In summary, our paper considers multiple factors, our model is reliable and practical for handling smart growth in reality
